    Text_Instructions = "<p>Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) are the main source of global climate change. <br> </p> <p> One way to tackle this is with a 'carbon tax.' <br> A carbon tax is a fee on the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions that come with the production and consumption of various products and activities. This may include, but is not limited to, fossil fuels, agricultural products like meat and dairy, and industrial processes. It has the goal to make people and businesses reduce their emissions. <br> The tax is usually a fixed price per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted for a certain activity or product. <br></p><p> In addition to cutting emissions, the money collected by the carbon tax can be used for several purposes, for instance, to address social injustice or further reduce emissions. <br><p> The government has various possibilities to design policies for a carbon tax. Imagine, therefore, that the U.S. Federal Government announces a public vote about the introduction of a carbon tax. <br> This carbon tax could vary in different features. These features as well as an example will be explained to you on the next page. <br> <br> Following that, we ask you to vote in 12 hypothetical public votes for or against the introduction of a carbon tax. <br></p>"

    # Task Example 
    Title_taskExample = "Instructions on your task - task example"
    example_taskExample = "This is how a hypothetical carbon tax vote looks like in our task."
    intro_attributes = "These policies can vary in the following features: "
    attributes_sector = "<b>Carbon pricing sector</b> <br> The tax could be imposed <b>in general on all emissions/ton of CO<sub>2</sub></b> caused by services, production processes and energy generation. Alternatively, the tax could be imposed only on emissions for <b>meat and dairy/ton of CO<sub>2</sub></b>, or on emissions caused by <b>energy generation/ton of CO<sub>2</sub></b>. The latter would include, for example, electricity, petrol or heating oil."
    attributes_price = "<b>Price per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</b> <br> Depending on the price per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, different outcomes in terms of national carbon neutrality can be achieved. Carbon-neutral means, that no more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are released into the atmosphere than can be taken out again. With a price of <b>$60 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub></b> carbon neutrality could be achieved past mid-century, around 2060. With respect to price increases, this would lead, for instance, to a price increase for 1lbs of pork of 0,19$ (Meat & Dairy), a price increase of 0,06$ for 1kWh of electricity from coal (Energy generation), and a price increase of 0,66$ for an average T-shirt (General on all emissions). <br> With a price of <b>$120 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub></b> carbon neutrality could be achieved by mid-century, around 2050. With a price of $120 per ton of CO2 carbon neutrality could be achieved by mid-century, around 2050. This would lead, for instance, to a price increase for 1lbs of pork of 0,38$ (Meat & Dairy), a price increase of 0,12$ for 1kWh of electricity from coal (Energy generation), and a price increase of 1,32$ more for an average T-shirt (General on all emissions)."
    attributes_revenue = "<b>Revenue mechanism </b> <br> The money collected (i.e., the carbon tax revenue) by imposing a tax on carbon emissions could be either <b>paid back as a dividend</b> to each citizen. This would mean that social injustice could be balanced out, as people who cause high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would also have to pay more tax, but the dividend would be the same for all citizens. In this way, people who cause few CO<sub>2</sub> emissions benefit from the tax contributions of those who emit a lot. Another option would be, that the revenue would be <b>reinvested in Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies</b>. These novel technologies are able to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and therefore contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> reduction." 
    attributes_timing = "<b>Implementation timing</b> <br> The start of the policy packages could be <b>in 1 year</b> or <b>in 7 years</b>. The duration and effects (revenue, additional taxes) refer to the starting point for the concrete implementation of the decided measures. That means, if a policy package is implemented in 7 years, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will only be reduced from that point onward, and additional taxes will also be imposed from that time."
    button_info_CDR = "Further information on these technologies can be opened "
    more_info_CDR = "Carbon dioxide removal technologies are technologies that use various methods to remove CO2 emissions from the atmosphere and store them for the long term. These include, for example, reforestation, moorland humidification but also solutions such as 'direct air capture'. Here, huge fans suck in air and separate the CO2 it contains and press it into a hard block. This can then be stored underground, for example. There are many more such technologies, which are summarised in the following image:"

    explain_Example = "<i>That is, in the example above, the government proposes a carbon tax policy where <b>in general all emissions</b> are taxed with a price of <b>$120 per ton</b>. The collected money would be used for <b>Investment in Carbon Dioxide Removal</b> technology and the tax would start <b>in 7 years</b> from now.</i> <br>"
    instr_continue = "You will now be presented with <b>12 hypothetical policy proposals</b> one after another. <br> For each of them you can vote with <b>Yes</b> or <b>No</b>, whether or not you would accept the policy proposal. <br> Please look at each policy proposal carefully and take some time to make your vote. <br> The order in which the 4 features are presented will change across the 12 examples."
