"

Based on the 6 behaviors, a small carbon footprint (for a person in the United States) would equal about 0.7 ton of CO<sub>2</sub>  per year and a large carbon footprint about 5.3 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> . <br> On the scale of 1 to 10, each increase of 1 (e.g., from 2 to 3 or from 7 to 8) corresponds to an increase of about 500 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> . <br>  "
